## Browser support

Due to utilization of bleeding-edge web standards, browser support is limited.
Your browser should support:

* ECMAScript 2015
* Web Components
* CSS Grid Layout

Latest versions of Mozilla Firefox and Chromium (including derivatives) will
work.

In Firefox, you have to enter `about:config` in the address bar, and toggle
following flags:
* `dom.webcomponents.enabled`,
* `layout.css.grid.enabled`.

In Chromium, you have to enter `chrome://flags/` in address bar, and enable
*Experimental Web Platform features*.
